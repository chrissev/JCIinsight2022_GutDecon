# Raw_metagenomic_sequencing_for_Pediatrics_Gut_Decontamination_NCT02641236
# A Randomized Phase 2 Study to examine the impact of gut decontamination (GD) with oral vancomycin-polymyxin B on the 
# intestinal microbiome composition in pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). 
# Exploratory aims look at clinical outcomes including acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and the risk of bloodstream 
# infections (BSI).
